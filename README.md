## The game
The aim of the game is to keep your power on for as long as possible, by using items around the map.
You also need to be aware of the ghost, as if it gets to near it will rapidly leech your power.
In order to find the ghost, you can press **F** to switch to spectral view, the ghost will show up through walls as a solid block whilst the rest of the world will only show a wireframe view.

### Item storage
You can store up to four items in your backpack (**B**), by dragging them into a square. Any items left outside the backpack when you close it will be discarded.

### Controls
- To walk, use **W**, **A**, **S** and **D**
- To consume an item or interact, use  **E**
- To open your backpack, use **B**
- To switch between normal and spectral view, use **f**
